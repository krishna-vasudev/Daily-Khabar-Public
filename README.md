## Introduction
There are various news apis available over the internet. But [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) was the most interesting one i came across. Moreover it's free plan offered much more features compared to other apis so i thought of a developing an android application using this api. So i developed Daily Khabar ,an android news application showing live and dynamic news from the internet.
